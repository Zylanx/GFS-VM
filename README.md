# GFS-VM
Just a tiny rubbish little toy stack-machine VM for my python bot  
  
This is just for fun and was done _very_ quickly. Do not take it as being an accurate demonstration of my skill nor is it a demonstration of how to do a stack machine. It was simply just to bodge up a little thing for fun in ~< 1 hour
